# usefulShellScripts4MB

I created these scripts to make my life with my MBPRetina a little bit more convenient ;) Feel free to contact me! 


1. Shell script to easily launch Matlab from the command line in order to support MBPRetinaResolution 
2. Download the latest java rte and copy the directory content from "/Library/InternetPlug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/"
      into
      "/Applications/Matlab_2014a.app/sys/java/jre/maci64/jre/"
3. Now go to your .bash_profile which you can find at /Users/yourUsername
4. Add the aliases to your .bash_profile which I provided in aliases.txt
5. Download .sharpMatlab.sh and make sure to place it at /Users/yourUsername your all set and ready to have Matlab running sharply on your MBPRetina
